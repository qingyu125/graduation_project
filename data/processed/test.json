    "text": "Dream into Action is the second studio album by the British pop musician Howard Jones。It was released in March 1985 and reached No.2 in the UK Album Charts。The album also reached the top ten in the US。The album went gold and platinum in many countries including the US and UK。The album contained the hit singles \" Things Can Only Get Better \" UK # 6 US # 5 \" Look Mama \" UK # 10 \" Life in One Day \" UK # 14 US # 19 and \" Like to Get to Know You Well \" UK # 4 though this was not included on the original UK vinyl or cassette editions。The version of \" No One Is to Blame \" that is featured on the initial release of this album is not the hit single version ; this song was entirely re recorded in a substantially re arranged version by Phil Collins for single release。The re recorded version of \" No One Is to Blame \" reached # 16 in the UK and # 4 in the US in 1986 and was included on a later second European pressing of the album。In 2010 the album was remastered and re released along with Jones ' debut album Human 's Lib...",

    "text": "The Cairns Western Arterial Road is a numbered state route in the Cairns Region of Queensland Australia。The road provides a primary access route across the Brinsmead Gap for suburbs west of the Whitfield Range and is one of two major crossings over the Barron River。In 2007 it was estimated that 24,000 vehicles per day used the road。After proceeding north west for 2.4 km from the Bruce Highway at Bungalow the dual carriageway road alignment follows Reservoir Road west of a signalised intersection with Pease Street in the suburb of Manoora。A number of suburban streets connect directly to the arterial between here and Enmore Road。West of Enmore Road the route rises over high terrain。A grade separated interchange provides access to McManus Street Whitfield through this section。Beyond this point access from some side streets is possible as the alignment passes Kanimbla and Brinsmead。Turning north from Brinsmead to follow the Redlynch Valley the road becomes a single carriageway passing over the Kuranda Scenic Rail...",
